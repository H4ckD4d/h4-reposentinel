Defensive repository and CI/CD configuration audits

## A Red Team hacker mindset, turned into useful technology

Chris Cruz, known as @h4ckd4d, brings experience across electronics, networks, infrastructure, software development, and cybersecurity. A Red Team mindset is not a license to attack: it is about asking difficult questions, examining risks with authorization, and building stronger solutions. Every project starts with a question. What if a practical challenge could become a public, verifiable tool for technical communities, designed with security from the beginning?

> An ethical hacker perspective. Red Team discipline. Responsibility to real people.
